MapleStory Wz Motion consists of a set of png files.
I have to make these files into one png files as it is fast to render in directX programs. 

There are two buttons; Load All, Animate.

To understand how it work, you have to know how a wz file consisting MapleStory offers motion images. It is a set of png file. 
Exactly, WzComparerR2 interprets wz files and gives a set of png files. 

To operate normally, We have to prepare images files generated by WzComparerR2 and put images in a folder for each motion type like jump or walk etc
.
If [Load All] is clicked, file browser works for you to find one of motion files. 
Just opening a one png file is sufficient. 
This programs automatically combine each folder of motion type and make a keyframe info file.

[Animate] button opens file brower for a combined file. If clicked, a info file for the choosen file is read as well as the choosen image.  Then shows motions. 

Other two buttons are for setting diretory of generated images file and the info file.

Just by copying the codes about the part, I expect you can modify your program easlily.
